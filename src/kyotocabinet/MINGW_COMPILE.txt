Compiling Kyoto Cabinet with MinGW

Compile and install regex (in src/kyotocabinet/mingw-libgnurx-2.5.1, or from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Other/UserContributed/regex/mingw-regex-2.5.1/). This is a little tricky because you'll need versions for 32- and 64-bit MinGW. So first, using 64-bit MinGW:

	> make clean
	> ./configure --prefix=/mingw/mingw64/x86_64-w64-mingw32 [your path may be different]
	> make 
	> make install

Then using 32-bit MinGW:

	> make clean
	> ./configure --prefix=/mingw/mingw32/i686-w64-mingw32
	> make
	> make install

Now Kyoto Cabinet. Stockfish doesn't use the compression features of Kyoto Cabinet, so we're not compiling zlib into it. If you want, you can build and install zlib as above and remove the --disable-zlib flag below.

	32-bit:
	> ./configure --disable-zlib --enable-static
	> make

	64-bit: this is slightly more complicated because of type-casting problems
	> ./configure --disable-zlib --enable-static
	now edit the makefile and add the -fpermissive flag to CXXFLAGS
	> make

Congratulations, you did it.
